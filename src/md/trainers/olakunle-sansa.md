## About Sansa

Olakunle Sansa holds a bachelors degree in Plant breeding and Seed
Technology as well as an MSc and PhD in Plant Breeding from the
Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria. In 2020, He
joined the Genetic Resources Center, International Institute of
Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan as a doctoral research fellow. His
work focused on studying photosynthesis under real field conditions
and exploring novel sources of tolerance to drought, heat stress and
Striga gesnerioides in diverse cowpea germplasm collections. In 2021,
he was awarded a UK/FCDO Commonwealth Split-site PhD Scholarship at
the Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich, U.K.
Following the completion of his PhD, he had a visiting research stay
at the John Innes Center, UK, where he worked on peas. He returned
back to IITA as a postdoctoral researcher where he is now advancing
research on improving photosynthesis and breeding for climate
resilience in cowpea. He is strongly passionate about strengthening
the capacity of African researchers and supporting smallholder farmers
for improved livelihood and sustainable food production in sub-Saharan
Africa.
