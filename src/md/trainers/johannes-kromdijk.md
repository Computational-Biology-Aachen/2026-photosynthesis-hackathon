## About Johannes

Growing up in an area of The Netherlands with an abundance of
glasshouses, Johannes became interested in plants at an early age. He
obtained his BSc and MSc in Plant Sciences at Wageningen University
(NL). In 2007 he was awarded the Alexander James Keith PhD studentship
to work with Prof. Howard Griffiths at the University of Cambridge
(UK), where he studied the effects of light limitation on the
efficiency of the carbon concentrating mechanism in C4 photosynthesis.
After finishing his PhD, he worked as a research scientist in
greenhouse horticulture in Wageningen (NL) for three years, focusing
on crop management strategies to optimize photosynthesis and energy
use efficiency. In 2013, he joined the Carl R. Woese Institute for
Genomic Biology (University of Illinois, USA) to work on genetic
improvement of the efficiency of photosynthesis. Johannes has since
returned to Cambridge and currently is an Associate-Professor at the
Department of Plant Sciences and a fellow at Pembroke College.
Johannes is a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow and recipient of the SEB
President’s medal in 2020. His research group employs a range of
techniques from ecophysiology, mathematical modelling, biotechnology
and genetic engineering to study plant physiology at the nexus of
basic understanding of plant function and applications to improve
sustainability and food security.
