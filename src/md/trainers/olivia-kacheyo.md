## About Olivia

Olivia is a post-doc at the Jan IngenHousz Institute. Her project
assesses how photosynthesis is related to yield while accounting for
environmental, phenological and other factors that influence
photosynthesis measurements under field conditions. Specifically, the
project aims to assess the availability of naturally occurring genetic
variation for photosynthetic traits in diverse populations of barley
and potato under field conditions by measuring photosynthesis at
different crop growth stages across the growing season. Currently
field photosynthesis data are collected using handheld devices but are
soon to be replaced with real time monitoring sensors that will
continuously measure photosynthesis throughout the crops life cycle in
the field.
