## About Jacky

I am a PhD student in the Laboratory of Genetics at Wageningen University. While originally focusing on Plant Genetics, I have branched out into more computational disciplines. I obtained a double MSc in Plant Sciences and Bioinformatics at Wageningen University, specializing in both plant genetics and deep learning, with a particular interest in computer vision for plant phenotyping!
Currently I’m developing new methods for tracking biomass over time in field crops using remote sensing & AI, to study when photosynthesis can be the limiting factor in biomass production. By understanding such photosynthetic limitations, we can understand how photosynthesis could be optimized to increase crop productivity. The hackathon aims to contribute to this same goal. Therefore, I am excited to join this hackathon to share perspectives from my own project and learn form the perspectives of others! Furthermore, I believe I can contribute as a bridge between plant geneticists and those of more computational disciplines, using my multidisciplinary background.
