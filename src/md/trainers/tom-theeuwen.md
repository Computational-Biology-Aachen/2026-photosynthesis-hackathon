## About Tom

Tom is highly motivated to use genetics to gain new insights into
photosynthetic functioning in crops. His foundation in this field was
established during his BSc and MSc in Plant Sciences and Plant
Biotechnology at Wageningen University & Research, where he
specialized in statistics and bioinformatics. During an internship at
the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics, he applied this
expertise to investigate drought tolerance in durum wheat. He was
later awarded his own PhD proposal by the Dutch Research Council
(NWO), during which he developed and applied a novel method to study
the contribution of organellar genetic variation to photosynthetic
phenotypes. During his PhD he contributed significantly to the design
and construction of the climate chamber module at the Netherlands
Plant Eco-physiology Centre. Since September 2023, Tom has been a
Research Fellow at the Jan IngenHousz Institute, where he uses genetic
variation to study photosynthetic limitations to biomass production.
Together with a multidisciplinary team, he is developing methods to
identify these limitations by using state-of-the-art wearable sensors
that continuously monitor photosynthesis in field-grown crops.
