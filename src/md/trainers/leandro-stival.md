## About Leandro

Leandro Stival is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Wageningen University & Research (WUR). He earned his PhD in Computer Science at UNICAMP(2025), focusing on the development of advanced machine learning architectures and foundational AI models on computer vision and spatio-temporal data.


His research bridges the gap between cutting-edge computational methods and practical data challenges. He specializes in the integration of State Space Models (SSMs), Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Attention Methods (Transformers), with a specific focus on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Explainable AI (XAI), and Computer Vision. By applying these methodologies to Time
Series Forecasting and Remote Sensing, he aims to develop interpretable and efficient spatio-temporal models that solve complex problems in modern agricultural and biological systems.
