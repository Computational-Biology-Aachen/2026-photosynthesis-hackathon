# Summary

Dr. Georgina Lala Ehemba is a Senegalese plant breeder with extensive academic and research experience. She earned a Bachelor’s in Life Sciences and a Master’s in Plant Pathology and Crop Protection, focusing on downy mildew resistance in pearl millet and screening groundnut lines for resistance to Cercospora leaf spot.

With a European Union scholarship, SCIFSA, she completed a PhD in Plant Breeding at the West Africa Centre for Crop Improvement (WACCI), University of Ghana. Her doctoral research focused on developing maize varieties that can withstand drought and low-nitrogen
soils, supporting climate-smart agriculture and sustainable food production. Currently, she leads the Maize Breeding Program at the Senegalese Agricultural Research Institute (ISRA), working to create improved, resilient maize varieties that enhance food security
for Senegalese farmers.

Dr. EhembaShe is eager to join the Photosynthesis Hackathon because it connects scientific innovation with real-world climate challenges. She recognizes the crucial role of photosynthesis in sustainable agriculture and carbon management and wants to apply her plant breeding
expertise to create data-driven, practical solutions. She values collaboration across disciplines and sees the hackathon as a chance to innovate, learn, and contribute to the development of sustainable agricultural technologies that address both food security and climate resilience.
