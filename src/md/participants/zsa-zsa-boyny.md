# Summary

Zsa Zsa Boyny is a PhD student at Justus-Liebig-University Gießen, where her research focuses on overcoming linkage drag in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). She holds a Master's degree in “Integrated Plant and Animal Breeding” from the University of Göttingen, which gave her a strong foundation in quantitative and population genetics, breeding program design, and the analysis of marker and sequence data. Much of her PhD work is computer-based, using AlphaSimR simulations to evaluate how factors such as increased recombination rates affect genetic gain and prediction accuracy, complemented by hands-on climate chamber and field experiments.

Photosynthesis is a relatively new trait for Zsa Zsa – and that is precisely what excites her about this hackathon. She is eager to explore how genotypic variation links to photosynthetic performance and to bring a genetics and breeding perspective into a more physiological space, perhaps by incorporating environmental covariances or testing new modeling approaches.

She is drawn to the interdisciplinary and international nature of the event and looks forward to contributing her expertise in breeding simulations and population genetics, while learning from participants with diverse scientific backgrounds. She also sees this as a great opportunity to engage with the work and vision of IITA.
