# Summary
Femi Adekoya, popularly known as The Flying Farmer, is a PhD researcher at Harper Adams University and a Commonwealth Scholar working at the intersection of plant physiology, remote sensing, and crop modelling. His research develops knowledge-guided machine learning frameworks that integrate hyperspectral sensing, chlorophyll fluorescence, and crop growth models to detect stress and simulate yield responses in long-cycle tropical crops such as cassava.

His work focuses on translating physiological signals, including photosynthetic efficiency, radiation use efficiency, and canopy dynamics, into predictive agronomic intelligence. He is currently developing a Cassava Mosaic Disease aware modelling framework that links spectral and fluorescence indicators of photosynthetic disruption to yield formation under viral stress across Sub-Saharan Africa.

With over a decade of experience in drone-enabled agricultural sensing and field experimentation, Femi brings expertise in multi-scale data acquisition from leaf to canopy level, UAV phenotyping, and computational analysis in R and Python. He is motivated to collaborate at the interface of computational biology, plant biophysics, and systems modelling to better understand and simulate photosynthetic performance under stress.
