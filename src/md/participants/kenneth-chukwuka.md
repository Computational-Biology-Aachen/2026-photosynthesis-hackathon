# Summary

Mkpuma Kenneth Chukwuka is a PhD scholar supported by the CIMMYT VACS-Capacity Project and the ORPHAN Crops Project under the European Union’s Intra-Africa Mobility Programme. He is a plant scientist with a strong background in plant breeding, genetics, and molecular biology, with a particular interest in crop improvement under stress conditions. His research focuses on integrating phenotypic, physiological, and molecular data to understand genetic variation and improve productivity and resilience in underutilized (Opportunity) crops and staple crops, including Amaranthus species. Kenneth has experience in gene expression analysis, stress signaling pathways, and data-driven approaches for linking genotype to phenotype. 

He is motivated to participate in the JII Open Challenge Hackathon to strengthen his skills in advanced data analysis and interdisciplinary collaboration at the interface of photosynthesis, genetics, and computational biology. He is especially interested in exploring how large-scale field photosynthesis data can be integrated with genetic architecture to accelerate crop improvement. The hackathon offers a valuable opportunity to engage with experts from diverse disciplines, gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge analytical tools, and contribute to innovative solutions for improving photosynthetic efficiency and crop performance under real-world conditions.
