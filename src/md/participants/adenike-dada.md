# Summary

Dr Adenike O. Dada is a research scientist at the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (IAR&T), Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria. She obtained her doctoral degree from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, and received advanced research training at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan.

Her research focuses on building crop resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses, with particular emphasis on pathogen pressure and waterlogging. Her team is currently developing robust screening methodologies for cowpea lines under emerging waterlogging conditions and identifying tolerant genotypes for future breeding programmes.

Dr Dada is excited to participate in the hackathon to share her experience in linking photosynthetic traits with waterlogging stress in cowpea. She is particularly interested in discussing why photosynthetic efficiency provides a more stable and sensitive indicator of waterlogging stress compared with conventional agro-morphological traits.

She also looks forward to learning from other experts on strategies to enhance photosynthetic capacity in crops and how these improvements can contribute to greater crop resilience under climate-change-induced stresses, especially waterlogging.
