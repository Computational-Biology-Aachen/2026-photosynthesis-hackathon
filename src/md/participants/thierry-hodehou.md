# Summary

Thierry is a final-year PhD candidate in Plant Breeding and Genetics at the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar and a research fellow at the Regional Center of Excellence for Drought Adaptation, Senegal. He was awarded a DAAD scholarship to pursue his PhD in Senegal.

His doctoral research focused on modeling GxE using weather data and linked genetic variation in photoperiod-sensitive flowering to grain mold resistance across rainfall gradients. Part of his work involved applying KASP markers to validate trait introgression and support breeding decisions. Following a research stay at CIRAD (France) in quantitative genetics, he is currently evaluating genomic selection approaches to improve selection efficiency for yield stability under variable environments.

As a Borlaug Norman Scholar, Thierry is a member of the African Plant Breeding Association and the North American National Association of Plant Breeders. He is eager to join the Photosynthesis Hackathon to broaden his skills in genotype-to-phenotype approaches applied to photosynthesis, while expanding his interdisciplinary network and fostering new collaborations as he prepares for the next stage of his career.
