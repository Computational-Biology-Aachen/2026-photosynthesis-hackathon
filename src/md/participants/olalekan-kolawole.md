# Summary

Kolawole Olalekan is a crop researcher with a background in plant physiology, agronomy, and data-driven agricultural research. He holds a Master’s degree in Crop Science from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, and a Bachelor’s degree in Plant Physiology and Crop Production from the Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Nigeria. He is currently a Research Supervisor affiliated with the Cassava Breeding Program at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, where he contributes to field and laboratory-based research supporting cassava improvement.

His research experience spans crop yield quality improvement, field experimentation, nutrient uptake laboratory analyses, environment sensing with digital approach, and quantitative data analysis, including statistical modelling and machine learning applications in agriculture. Through his work at IITA, he has developed a growing interest in understanding the physiological basis of yield and stress adaptation, particularly processes related to photosynthesis and resource-use efficiency.

Kolawole is motivated to participate in the Photosynthesis Hackathon to deepen his understanding of photosynthetic processes, explore innovative analytical and computational approaches, and collaborate with interdisciplinary experts. He views the hackathon as a valuable opportunity to strengthen his research capacity and to refine ideas relevant to his prospective PhD research in plant physiology and crop improvement.
