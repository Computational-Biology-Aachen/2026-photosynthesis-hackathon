# Summary

Ihuoma Ogechi is a fourth-year PhD candidate in Plant Breeding at the West Africa Centre for Crop Improvement (WACCI), University of Ghana. She is also a graduate research fellow at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, and a Lecturer in the Department of Plant Science and Biotechnology at Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Nigeria. Her research interests are in crop improvement for climate resilience, with a focus on underutilized legume crops that are of high value to smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa. She combines expertise in plant breeding, physiology, quantitative analysis, and data analysis to investigate genotype performance in diverse environments and to develop stress-tolerant and yield-stable genotypes.

Her PhD work assesses the role of yield, agronomic, photosynthetic, and other related physiological traits in both optimum and drought environments to elucidate the mechanisms of stress tolerance and yield stability in Bambara groundnut with the aim of applying physiological knowledge to its breeding. Her research interests are driven by the need to apply scientific knowledge to develop practical solutions for sustainable agriculture and food security in sub-Saharan Africa.

The Photosynthesis Hackathon event is directly relevant to her research and professional interests as it will improve her knowledge of photosynthesis as a breeding objective, provide an opportunity to engage with other disciplines, and provide a platform to connect basic research with applied crop improvement. The event will improve her research, teaching, and training capacity as well as her ability to train students while addressing climate-smart agriculture.
