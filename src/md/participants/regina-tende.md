# Summary

I am a Chief Research Scientist at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), based at the National Drylands Research Center in Katumani, where I work on crop improvement for drought-prone, insect-pressure environments affecting smallholder farmers. With a PhD in Plant Breeding, an MSc in Crop Protection (Entomology), and extensive experience developing early-maturing, insect-resistant crops, my work focuses on improving yield stability while reducing reliance on chemical pest control.

I am motivated to attend the Photosynthesis Hackathon because my long-term goal is to advance crop improvement by integrating physiological efficiency with practical breeding outcomes. My background in plant breeding guides my focus on translating complex traits into field-ready varieties, while my entomology training shapes how I understand productivity within real agroecosystems where photosynthesis, defense, and resource allocation interact under biotic stress.

The opportunity to engage with scientists from other disciplines and understand how they fit into crop improvement under challenging environmental conditions is treasured. In addition, is how optimizing photosynthetic performance can strengthen source–sink relationships, improve stress tolerance, and support yield stability in resource-limited farming systems. The hackathon offers an opportunity to engage with cutting-edge approaches and evaluate how photosynthesis-focused innovations can be integrated into breeding pipelines.
