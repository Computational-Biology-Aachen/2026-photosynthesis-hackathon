# Summary

Andris is a PhD student in the Department of Plant Breeding at Justus Liebig University Giessen, Germany. His academic path began at University of Hohenheim in Agricultural Biology, where he initially focused on plant nutrition and molecular biology. During this time, his fascination with genetics and plant breeding emerged.

Consequently, he pursued a Master’s degree in Agrobiotechnology at Justus Liebig University Giessen, concentrating on population genetics, quantitative genetics, and other breeding-related disciplines.

During his studies, he completed an internship at a local cereal breeding company and worked as a trainee at Enza Zaden, one of the largest vegetable breeding companies worldwide. In addition, he served as a research assistant in the Department of Plant Breeding at Justus Liebig University Giessen, where he supported field trial preparations and laboratory work.

Since photosynthesis-related traits play an important role in his current work with near-infrared reflectance–based predictions of plant performance, he is particularly pleased to take part in the hackathon. At present, he works with oilseed rape hybrids, investigating molecular and environmental biases introduced into predictions through different data types and modelling approaches.


Through these experiences, he brings a solid background in plant breeding, complemented by practical experience in both vegetable and cereal breeding, and he hopes to gain new perspectives and insights from other disciplines, breeders, and scientists.
