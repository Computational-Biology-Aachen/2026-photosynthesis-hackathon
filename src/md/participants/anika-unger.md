# Summary

Anika Unger is a PhD student at Justus Liebig University Giessen, Germany, where she conducts her doctoral research in the Department of Plant Breeding. She is also a member of the Junior Research Group “Advanced Interaction Modelling for Genotype, Environment
and Management (AIM4GEM).” The primary objective of the AIM4GEM group is to develop and apply novel model-based approaches to advance the understanding of genotype-environment-management (G×E×M) interactions and to implement this knowledge in predictive breeding strategies aimed at
mitigating abiotic stresses associated with climate change.

She is very excited to join the Photosynthesis Hackathon, as it offers a unique opportunity to deepen her understanding of photosynthetic traits and to explore dynamic models of plant processes. She is particularly interested in the combination of hands-on sessions and
interactive learning, and in connecting quantitative approaches with plant phenotyping to better understand how photosynthesis influences crop performance.
