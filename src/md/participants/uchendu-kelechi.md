# Summary

Dr. Uchendu Ugochukwu Kelechi is a Senior Scientist at the National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI), Nigeria, where he leads activities in potato improvement and crop resilience. He holds a PhD in Plant Breeding from the University of Ghana, with research experience spanning plant breeding, disease resistance, and applied agricultural biotechnology in Africa. His work focuses on translating scientific research into practical solutions for improving crop productivity and food security under resource-limited and climate-challenged environments.

Dr. Kelechi is particularly interested in how advances in photosynthesis research, phenotyping, and data-driven modeling can accelerate crop improvement and enhance yield stability. He works at the interface of genetics, physiology, and applied breeding, and is keen to explore how quantitative and computational approaches can strengthen decision-making in crop development pipelines.

He is participating in the Photosynthesis Hackathon to learn from interdisciplinary experts, contribute a breeder’s perspective, and collaborate on innovative tools and ideas that can bridge fundamental photosynthesis research with real-world agricultural impact in Africa and beyond.
